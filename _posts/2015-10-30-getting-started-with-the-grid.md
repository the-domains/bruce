Excited to be getting started on The Grid. I hope to be using this space to share things that interest me and hopefully interest you. As I tend to have broad interests I'll attempt to keep this spot focused on only a couple segments - those being world travel and being a digital nomad/running a web company. And maybe a little wine and/or food..and maybe a little hockey..and perhaps a little on travelling with a youngster..and media..and  hmmm Well, you get the picture. I'll focus on travel and work/travel lifestyle but there'll be plenty of other stuff chucked in.

They call me Bruce. I run a large NHL (that's ice hockey for non North Americans) website that features about 130 writers. The site no affords me the luxury of time. I am now able to chose what I do with my time as opposed to my old employers dictating how I spent my time. It's a perfect Lifestyle business - one which I'll be very happy to answer any questions on. Now that the web business has matured and stabalized the Mrs. and I have decided to embark on a 13 month 'round the world voyage - with our young son coming along for the ride.

Going to try and sprinkle my posts with some of my photography. You're welcome to grab & use any image but a link back here or to greatletsgo.com would be appreciated. I'll keep this intro short and sweet and try to get comfortable with the new platform. Look for me to write more in the next couple days on our travel preparations - Iceland is Booked!
